            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The following data visualisation highlights the number of patients (per 100,000 patients) who have contracted sepsis both within 30 days of discharge
                and during surgical hospital addmission. These statistics were recorded in the following countries between the years 2014 and 2023:
            <ul>
                <li>Finland</li>
                <li>Israel</li>

                <li>New Zealand</li>

        <section class = "description">
            <p>Sepsis is a well-known life threatening condition that occurs when the body attacks its own organs and tissues as a result of an overwhelming and abnormal 
                immune response to an infeciton. Said infection can be anywhere in the body, such as an infected cut, lung infection or a urinary tract infeciton (UTI). 
                This results in septic shock (dramatic drop in blood pressure) and widespread organ failure. Spesis within patients will cause death if not diagnosed or 
                treated early. After a patient has been diagnosed with Sepsis, every day the patient survives is an extension to mortality. Early symptoms of Sepsis are 
                difficult to recognise as they may indicate alternative illnesses. However, symptoms progress quickly which is why it is important to know what to be 
                cautious of when monitoring smyptoms. Symptoms, of course, vary between adult patients, children and babies. Symptoms in adults may include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fast breathing/breathlessness.</li>
                    <li>Increased heart rate.</li>
                    <li>Fever or low temperature/chills.</li>
                    <li>Drowsiness, confusion or slurred speech.</li>
                    <li>Muscle aches, headaches and nausea.</li>
                    <li>Vommiting or diarrhoea.</li>
                    <li>Reduced urine.</li>
                    <li>Discoloured skin.</li>
                </ul>

                Spesis in older children may appear different to sepsis in younger children. Newborns, however, often have non-specific symptoms such as feeding difficulties 
                or irritablity, which ultimately makes it harder to detect. Other symptoms may include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Pauses in breathing.</li>
                    <li>Cold skin or rash that does not fade when pressed.</li>
                    <li>Few wet nappies.</li>
                    <li>Floppy limbs or reslessness.</li>
                    <li>Seizures.</li>
                    <li>Unexplained severe pain.</li>
                </ul>

            <p class= "warning">Sepsis is a medical emergency. Should you suspect that yourself or someone else has contracted sepsis, call triple zero (000) and ask for an 
                ambulance or go to your nearest emergency department for immediate diagnoses and treatment.
