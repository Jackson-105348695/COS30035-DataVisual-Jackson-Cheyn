            <h2>Dataset Manipulation</h2>
            <p>The dataset chosen for this data visualisation was discussed and chosen with <i>all</i> team members present. Changes were made to the dataset, however said changes did not result in any major 
            deviation from the overarching topic at hand. The changes to the dataset were as follows:</p>

            <ul class = "list">
                <li>Removed data related to irrelevant illnesses (which created entirely different circumstances).</li>
                <li>Removed countries that contained missing dataset within the chosen time period.</li>
                <li>Split into two separate sections for audiences to compare and contrast.</li>
            </ul>
